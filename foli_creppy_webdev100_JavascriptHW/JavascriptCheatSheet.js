// Trick question, just because variable isn't less than 10 doesn't mean it is greater,
// it could be equal to 10 so just regular else wouldn't do
if(x_value < 10) {
	alert('Variable less than 10');
} else if(x_value > 10) { {
	console.log(x_value + ' is greater than 10');

//6:

//this one isn't really a answer to write, you would basically have to change the value of that variable like:

	var x_value = 5;

//then run the code:

	if(x_value < 10) {
	window.alert('Variable less than 10');
  else if(x_value > 10){
    
  }
	console.log(x_value + 'is greater than 10');


//and keep doing that every time u change the value...
